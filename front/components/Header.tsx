          Berlin Schlag has been created to talk to you directly. These days,
          it's rare to feel familiar with a media's editorial policy. That's why
          BERLINSchlag is spreading stories as a friend could do during a party
          or a sunday walk. So please open your ears, your eyes and take your
          time to read what we are sharing with you!
